# Pseudouridine-predictor-Pse-MA
Predicting pseudouridine sites is a non-linear classification problem with limited data points. Deep Learning models are efficient discriminators when the data set size is reasonably large and fails when there is paucity in data. To mitigate this problem, we propose a SVM Kernel based on utility theory from Economics.
