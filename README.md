 # Pseudouridine-predictor-Pse-MA
Predicting pseudouridine sites is a non-linear classification
problem with limited data points. We propose a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Kernel based on utility
theory from Economics, and using data driven parameters (i.e. MSU) as
features. The proposed model outperforms the existing state
of the art models significantly (15% âˆ’ 20% on average).
